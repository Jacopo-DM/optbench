# PLAN.md

## Goal

A library of optimisation test functions with known answers, built from the
optimisation pages of the SFU Virtual Library of Simulation Experiments, for
testing optimisation algorithms (CGP-based ones from `ailigment`, and any
other). The approved spec and task list are in DESIGN.md.

## Current state (2026-10-17)

- Tier 1 (walking skeleton) done and on `main` (4133d55; `main` had no
  commits, so the branch `tier1-skeleton` simply became `main`).
- Private GitHub repo `Jacopo-DM/optbench` created and `main` pushed
  (2026-10-16, the user's say-so).
- Tier 2, the functions: all six SFU groups are done, 49 functions, on
  `main` and pushed (ced98e3, 2026-10-17): 500 tests, coverage 100%, ruff and
  pyright clean, and every function evaluates 100,000 points in under 55 ms.
  Every feature branch so far was merged and deleted on the user's say-so;
  the working tree is clean.
- Tier 2 is complete (2026-10-17): `optbench.random_search` (the baseline)
  and the timing and baseline scripts (now `src/optbench/scripts/`);
  results in DESIGN.md.
  All 49 functions are under the 100 ms budget. On `main` and pushed
  (2026-10-17); the branch `tier2-baseline` was deleted.
- `classics` done (2026-10-17, branch `classics`): ten functions, 605
  tests, coverage 100%, ruff and pyright clean. Whitley is over the speed
  budget at d = 10, a stated exception (the user, 2026-10-17; DESIGN.md).
- `bbob` complete (2026-10-17, five commits, one per group, each merged
  and its branch deleted on the user's say-so): all 24 functions equal to
  `cocoex` (1e-9 for f16 to f19 and f23, 1e-12 for the rest; DESIGN.md
  results); 83 functions in all, 1578 tests, 100% branch coverage over
  `src` and `tests`; ruff, mypy strict and pyright strict clean.
- Git: `main` is pushed up to 1385e82. The `python-standard` work (65b1971
  to c44f77f) is on `main`, not pushed: GitHub refused the push on
  2026-10-17 because the `gh` token (scopes `gist`, `read:org`, `repo`)
  lacks `workflow`, which any push adding `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  needs. The user runs `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow`, then
  the push can go. Branch `python-standard` is deleted;
  `spec-python-standard` (merged) still exists.
- `ailigment` does not use this library yet; its adapters are separate
  modules in that repo (see its PLAN.md).

## Constraints

- See CLAUDE.md rules: no import of `ailigment`, numpy and pydantic only at
  run time,
  formulas not GPL code.
- Python >=3.13 to match `ailigment`.

## Next step

Once the user has added the `workflow` scope (see Current state), push
`main` and read the first CI run (see item 1 below). Then the `ailigment` migration.

## Next steps in priority order (approved modules, 2026-10-17)

The user approved both specs (now in DESIGN.md, "Approved spec: bbob and
classics") and their task lists on 2026-10-17, with the order: classics,
then BBOB, then the `ailigment` adapters. Downloading RR-6829 (573,076
bytes, from https://inria.hal.science/inria-00362633/document) and adding
COCO's Python package as a dev-only dependency are approved too.

1. done locally, CI not run yet: module `python-standard` (approved
   2026-10-17, commits ae6f494 to the pre-commit and CI commit on branch
   `python-standard`, merged into `main`). The spec, the user's four
   answers and what the work found are in DESIGN.md ("Python standard"
   under Decisions, the results row, the rejected approach). The first CI
   run happens on the next push and is unverified: it compiles cocoex from
   source on ubuntu-latest; if that fails, stop and tell the user.

2. later: the same migration for `ailigment`, then its adapters (its
   PLAN.md).

## Open questions for the user

None.

## Known problems

- BBOB f16 takes about 93 ms per 100,000 points at d = 10, close to the
  0.1 s budget; under heavier load it may cross it. T_osz (shared by seven
  BBOB functions) and the rotations are 37 ms of that; speeding up T_osz
  would help them all.
- Power Sum's recommended b vector is given for d = 4 only (other b give
  other dimensions, with an unknown minimum). Langermann's constants are for
  d = 2; other dimensions work when the caller passes `a`
  (and its minimum is then unknown).
- Functions whose minimum was found numerically (or is published without a
  proof for other constants) know it only at the
  published constants; any changed constant gives `minimum is None`. A
  caller who wants the minimum of a variant must search for it.
